## Brief

Write the Python codes for the following questions.

## Instructions

Paste the answer as Python in the answer code section below each question.

### Question 1

Question: The scraping of `https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/` in the last section assumes a hardcoded (fixed) no of pages. Can you improve the code by removing the hardcoded no of pages and instead use the `Â»` button to determine if there are more pages to scrape? Hint: Use a `while` loop.

```python
def parse_and_extract_rows(soup: BeautifulSoup):
    """
    Extract table rows from the parsed HTML.

    Args:
        soup: The parsed HTML.

    Returns:
        An iterator of dictionaries with the data from the current page.
    """
    header = soup.find('tr')
    headers = [th.text.strip() for th in header.find_all('th')]
    teams = soup.find_all('tr', 'team')
    for team in teams:
        row_dict = {}
        for header, col in zip(headers, team.find_all('td')):
            row_dict[header] = col.text.strip()
        yield row_dict
```
